# Glossary Prompts

please generate a glossary of terms for all the technical terms in this book.  Go through all the markdown files under the docs directory.  For 
  each document, identify any technical terms the average high-school teacher might not understand.  Then place this term in the glossary.md file 
  in alphabetical order.  Place the term name in a level four markdown header.  Then provide an ISO defintion for the term.

‚è∫ I'll create a comprehensive glossary by analyzing all the markdown files in the docs directory to identify technical terms that might be
  unfamiliar to high school teachers.
