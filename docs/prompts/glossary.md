  Please generate a glossary of terms for all the technical terms in this book.  
  Go through all the markdown files under the docs directory.
  For each document, identify any technical terms the average high-school teacher might not understand.  
  Then place each term in the glossary.md file in alphabetical order.  
  Place the term name in a level four markdown header.  
  Then provide an ISO definition for the term.
