# Thonny Admin

Based on your situation without Education Upgrade, here are streamlined steps to configure each Chromebook more efficiently:

## Faster Setup Process

### Step 1: Enable Linux Development Environment
1. Open **Settings** (click time, then gear icon)
2. Scroll to **About ChromeOS** ‚Üí **Developers**
3. Click **Set up** next to "Linux development environment"
4. Follow prompts (allocate at least 10GB disk space)
5. Wait for installation (5-10 minutes)

### Step 2: Efficient Thonny Installation
Instead of using `apt install thonny` (which gives older versions), use the official installer:

```bash
# Update system first
sudo apt update

# Install latest Thonny with Python bundle
bash <(wget -O - https://thonny.org/installer-for-linux)
```

This method installs the current version (3.3.10+) rather than the outdated Debian package version, avoiding compatibility issues.

### Step 3: Configure USB Access
1. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **About ChromeOS** ‚Üí **Developers** ‚Üí **Linux development environment**
2. Click **Manage USB devices**
3. Connect your USB device (Arduino, Raspberry Pi Pico, etc.)
4. **Enable** the device in the list
5. Add user to dialout group: `sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER`
6. **Restart** the Linux container (Settings ‚Üí Developers ‚Üí Linux ‚Üí Advanced ‚Üí Restart)

### Step 4: Create Desktop Launcher
Make Thonny easily accessible:

```bash
# Create desktop file for launcher
cat > ~/.local/share/applications/thonny.desktop << EOF
[Desktop Entry]
Name=Thonny
Comment=Python IDE for beginners
Exec=thonny %F
Icon=thonny
Terminal=false
Type=Application
Categories=Development;IDE;
MimeType=text/x-python;
EOF

# Make executable
chmod +x ~/.local/share/applications/thonny.desktop
```

## Time-Saving Tips

### Use Container Backup/Restore
After configuring one Chromebook completely, you can back up the Linux container and restore it to other devices:

**Create backup on first device:**
1. Open **Terminal**
2. Run: `vmc export termina`
3. This creates a backup file in Downloads folder
4. Copy this file to a USB drive

**Restore on other devices:**
1. Enable Linux development environment
2. Copy backup file to Downloads
3. Run: `vmc import termina [backup-filename]`
4. Restart Linux container

### Batch Script Approach
Create a setup script to automate the software installation:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Save as setup_thonny.sh

echo "Setting up Thonny development environment..."

# Update system
sudo apt update

# Install Thonny
bash <(wget -O - https://thonny.org/installer-for-linux)

# Add user to dialout group
sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER

# Create desktop launcher
cat > ~/.local/share/applications/thonny.desktop << EOF
[Desktop Entry]
Name=Thonny
Comment=Python IDE for beginners
Exec=thonny %F
Icon=thonny
Terminal=false
Type=Application
Categories=Development;IDE;
MimeType=text/x-python;
EOF

chmod +x ~/.local/share/applications/thonny.desktop

echo "Setup complete! Please restart Linux container and connect USB devices."
echo "Go to Settings > Developers > Linux > Manage USB devices to enable your hardware."
```

Run with: `bash setup_thonny.sh`

## Guest Account Limitations

**Important consideration:** If Chromebooks are managed by your school, Linux development environment might be disabled for guest accounts. You may need to:

- Use individual student accounts instead of guest accounts
- Check with your IT department about Linux policies
- Consider using web-based Python IDEs as an alternative

This approach should reduce your setup time from several hours to about 15-20 minutes per device, especially if you use the container backup/restore method after setting up the first one.

# Step by Step Guide for Setting Up Developer Mode

## How to Put a Chromebook into Developer Mode: Step-by-Step Guide

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** Enabling Developer Mode will wipe all local data, including files, apps, and settings. Be sure to back up anything important before you begin.

## ‚úÖ Step 0: Prepare

* **Backup your data** (Google Drive, USB stick, or external hard drive).
* Make sure your **Chromebook is charged or plugged in**.
* Know that Developer Mode **disables verified boot**, so you‚Äôll see a scary screen every time you start up ‚Äî this is expected.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Step 1: Enter Recovery Mode

1. Turn off your Chromebook.
2. Press and hold these keys simultaneously:

   * **Esc** + **Refresh (üîÅ)**, then press the **Power** button.
3. Release all keys when you see a **white screen with a yellow exclamation mark** or a message like "Chrome OS is missing or damaged."

## ‚öôÔ∏è Step 2: Enable Developer Mode

1. On the recovery screen, press **Ctrl + D**.
2. You will be prompted:
   ‚ÄúTo turn OS verification OFF, press ENTER.‚Äù
3. Press **Enter**.

## üßπ Step 3: Wait for Powerwash (Device Reset)

* The system will reboot and begin the **transition to Developer Mode**.
* This takes **5 to 10 minutes**. You‚Äôll see a screen that says:

  > "Preparing system for Developer Mode. This may take a while."

This process **erases all local data** (Powerwash), and once complete, the device will reboot again.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Step 4: Startup Behavior in Developer Mode

Every time you boot, you‚Äôll see a **‚ÄúOS verification is OFF‚Äù** screen.

* To continue booting: press **Ctrl + D** or wait 30 seconds.
* To go back to normal mode: press **Spacebar**, then confirm.

## üõ†Ô∏è Step 5: Access the Linux Shell (Crosh and Bash)

1. Once booted, sign into Wi-Fi.
2. Press **Ctrl + Alt + T** to open **Crosh** (Chrome Shell).
3. Type `shell` and press Enter.
4. Now you are in a full Bash shell and can run commands like `sudo`, install dev tools, or run scripts.

## üßØ Optional: Disable Root File System Verification

If you're doing root-level development:

```bash
sudo su
/usr/share/vboot/bin/make_dev_ssd.sh --remove_rootfs_verification
```

Then reboot.

## üîÑ To Exit Developer Mode (Re-enable Verified Boot)

1. Reboot your Chromebook.
2. On the "OS verification is OFF" screen, press **Spacebar**.
3. Confirm when prompted ‚Äî this will **Powerwash again** and return to normal mode.

## ‚úÖ Developer Mode Enabled!

You‚Äôre now ready to:

* Install custom Linux distros
* Sideload APKs (on supported Chromebooks)
* Access full root shell
* Modify system files and services
