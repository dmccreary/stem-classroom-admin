# # USB Device Security in Educational Environments: The Thonny Challenge

## Introduction

In modern educational settings, programming environments like Thonny have become essential tools for teaching computer science and electronics. Thonny, a beginner-friendly Python IDE, is particularly popular for its simplicity and built-in support for microcontrollers like the Raspberry Pi Pico, Arduino boards, and other educational hardware. However, the very feature that makes these tools valuable in education—their ability to interact with a wide variety of USB-connected devices—also presents significant security challenges in classroom environments.

The fundamental tension lies between educational functionality and institutional security. While students need access to program and debug microcontrollers, schools must protect their networks and systems from the myriad security threats that USB devices can introduce. This chapter explores these challenges and examines how different operating systems have evolved their USB security models to address these concerns.

## The Educational USB Challenge

### Why USB Access Matters in Programming Education

Programming education has evolved beyond purely software-based learning. Modern curricula emphasize hands-on experience with physical computing, IoT devices, and embedded systems. Students working with platforms like:

- Raspberry Pi Pico and Pi Zero
- Arduino Uno, Nano, and ESP32 boards  
- micro:bit devices
- CircuitPython-compatible microcontrollers
- Custom educational robotics platforms

These devices typically connect via USB and appear to the operating system as serial communication devices, mass storage devices, or composite devices that combine multiple interfaces. For Thonny to effectively program these devices, it requires:

- Serial port access for REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) interaction
- Mass storage access for direct file transfer to devices like CircuitPython boards
- Device enumeration capabilities to detect and identify connected hardware
- Low-level USB communication for firmware updates and debugging

### The Classroom Reality

In a typical classroom scenario, 20-30 students might simultaneously connect various microcontrollers to school computers. Each device presents as a unique USB endpoint with specific driver requirements and communication protocols. The instructor needs assurance that:

- All devices will be recognized consistently across different classroom computers
- Students cannot accidentally or intentionally introduce malicious devices
- The school's network and data remain secure
- IT administrative overhead remains manageable
- Educational goals are not compromised by security restrictions

## USB Security Threats: Understanding the Attack Surface

### The Fundamental USB Security Problem

USB was designed in the 1990s with convenience and plug-and-play functionality as primary goals, not security. The protocol inherently trusts connected devices and allows them to declare their own capabilities and identity. This trust-based model creates multiple attack vectors:

### BadUSB and Device Spoofing

The BadUSB attack, first demonstrated in 2014, revealed that USB device firmware could be reprogrammed to impersonate different device types. A seemingly harmless USB storage device could:

- Declare itself as a keyboard and inject malicious keystrokes
- Present as a network adapter and redirect traffic
- Appear as multiple device types simultaneously
- Persist malicious code in device firmware, making it undetectable by traditional antivirus

### Malicious Mass Storage Devices

USB storage devices can execute sophisticated attacks:

- **Autorun exploitation**: While largely mitigated in modern systems, legacy support and user behavior can still be exploited
- **File system attacks**: Malformed file systems can exploit OS parsing vulnerabilities
- **Hidden partitions**: Devices may contain multiple partitions, some invisible to standard file managers
- **Firmware-based persistence**: Malicious code embedded in device firmware can survive reformatting

### Supply Chain Attacks

In educational environments, USB devices often come from various sources:

- Donated equipment of unknown provenance  
- Student-owned devices with unknown modification history
- Bulk-purchased devices from suppliers with varying security standards
- Counterfeit devices that may contain malicious modifications

### Social Engineering Vectors

USB devices serve as powerful social engineering tools:

- "Lost" USB drives in parking lots (USB drops)
- Devices disguised as promotional materials
- Trojanized versions of legitimate educational hardware
- Student-to-student malware propagation via shared devices

## Operating System USB Security Strategies

### ChromeOS: The Zero-Trust Approach

ChromeOS represents the most restrictive approach to USB security, reflecting Google's security-first philosophy for educational environments.

**Core Security Principles:**

- **Default Deny**: USB devices are blocked by default, with explicit allowlisting required
