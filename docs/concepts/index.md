# Core Concepts in Administrating a STEM Coding Classroom with Physical Computing and AI

## USB Port Administration

One of the most challenging problem with setting up a STEM physical computing classroom us
allowing students to plug in a USB device.  We cover this in this chapter:

## USB Power Draw

Although 99.9% of the time our labs only use a small amount of power - under 100 milliamps.
This is under 10% of the power that most USB ports provide. 
However, when students are driving motors or large sets of LEDs, we can run
into problems.  This chapter guides you through the way computers supply
power to USB devices and how to monitor and recover from power draw issues.
