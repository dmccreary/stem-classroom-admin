a tool called [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)

Setting up Raspberry Pi systems for educational environments requires reliable, efficient tools for creating and deploying customized operating system images. This chapter explores the essential software tools, storage options, and best practices for generating and deploying Raspberry Pi images in STEM classroom environments.

## Raspberry Pi Imager: The Official Solution

### Overview and Features

Raspberry Pi Imager is the quick and easy way to install Raspberry Pi OS and other operating systems to a microSD card, ready to use with your Raspberry Pi. This official tool has evolved significantly since its introduction and now offers comprehensive customization options perfect for classroom deployment.

Raspberry Pi Imager 1.9.4 has been released as the latest stable version, bringing various UI improvements, new translations, and bug fixes. The current version includes several features that make it particularly valuable for educational environments:

**Advanced OS Customization**: The OS customisation menu lets you set up your Raspberry Pi before first boot. You can preconfigure hostname, username and password, wireless LAN settings, locale settings, and SSH access.

**Multi-Platform Support**: The imager runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux, making it accessible regardless of your institution's preferred operating system. The minimum supported Ubuntu version for the DEB version is Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, but the AppImage build may run on older versions.

**Enhanced Security Features**: In the OS customisation settings there's an Enable SSH tab that now uses "regex to perform some light validation" of public keys to avoid boot failures.

### Installation and Setup

The Raspberry Pi Imager can be downloaded from the official Raspberry Pi website at https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/. The tool automatically detects your operating system and provides the appropriate download, though you can manually select versions for different platforms.

**Key Installation Points:**
- Windows versions support both 32-bit and 64-bit architectures

## MicroSD Cards: Benefits, Limitations, and Reliability

### Benefits of MicroSD Cards

MicroSD cards have been the traditional storage solution for Raspberry Pi devices since the beginning. They offer several advantages for educational deployments:

**Accessibility and Cost**: MicroSD cards are widely available and relatively inexpensive, making them ideal for large classroom deployments where budget constraints are important.

**Portability**: The small form factor makes it easy to swap between different Pi units or create backup copies of working configurations.

**Simplicity**: All Raspberry Pi consumer models since the Raspberry Pi 1 Model A+ feature a microSD slot. Your Raspberry Pi automatically boots from the microSD slot when the slot contains a card.

### Limitations and Reliability Concerns

However, MicroSD cards come with significant limitations that educators should understand:

**Performance Limitations**: SD cards are inherently slower compared to other storage options like USB drives or solid-state drives (SSDs). As the Raspberry Pi writes and deletes data on the SD card over time, the performance may degrade.

**Durability Issues**: In applications where the Raspberry Pi writes data frequently, such as logging or databases, the constant read/write operations can significantly shorten the lifespan of the SD card.

**Corruption Risks**: SD cards are prone to corruption, especially in scenarios where the Raspberry Pi experiences sudden power loss or improper shutdowns. Users report frequent issues such as data corruption and unexpected failures, particularly when cards are subjected to the constant read-write cycles typical in SBC applications.

**Capacity Constraints**: SD cards typically offer limited storage capacity compared to alternative storage solutions like USB drives or SSDs.

### Performance Expectations

Understanding realistic performance expectations helps in project planning:

**Basic Performance**: In practice, you'll get about 100MB/s out of an SD card in a Pi

**Raspberry Pi 5 Improvements**: The SD card interface on the Pi5 has doubled in speed over the Pi 4 so that is a pretty good improvement

### Best Practices for MicroSD Reliability

To maximize MicroSD card reliability in classroom environments:

**Choose Quality Cards**: Cards that are "A" rated are compliant with the SD Association Application Performance Class standard and are optimized for running applications as well as storing data.

**Proper Power Supply**: The Raspberry Pi also needs a very good USB power supply, especially the Pi 3 and Pi 4. The official power supplies are great. With good quality storage and a good quality power supply like we can get these days, the Raspberry Pi is very reliable.

**Regular Backups**: Given the potential for failure, implementing a regular backup strategy is essential for educational deployments.

## Official Raspberry Pi MicroSD Cards

### Introduction and Features

Raspberry Pi launched official microSD cards, working on command queuing within the Raspberry Pi OS for improved performance. These cards are specifically optimized for Raspberry Pi hardware.

**Performance Optimization**: At the moment, the Official Raspberry Pi SD Card is definitely the one you need. This SD card ranked first in all tests, often well ahead of others.

**Command Queuing Support**: Command queuing support for microSD cards allows the microSD card to queue commands/tasks and perform them in the most efficient way possible, allowing it to perform many tasks faster than it would without it.

### Availability and Specifications

The official Raspberry Pi microSD cards are available at https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/sd-cards/ in multiple capacities. Initially, distributors were offering 32/64GB variants, often with Raspberry Pi OS pre-installed.

**Performance Benefits**: The 32GB Raspberry Pi microSD card sees the most benefit from command queuing, but when we move up to the 64 and 128GB capacities, we're already seeing them perform close to their limits.

### Cost Considerations

The 128GB microSD card purchased from BERRYBASE was around $15.70 including taxes, and the 256GB Raspberry Pi NVMe SSD was around $37 including taxes. When you throw in the performance gains, it's worth the investment for demanding applications.

## NVMe Drives and Raspberry Pi 5: The Next Generation

### Introduction to NVMe on Raspberry Pi 5

The new external PCIe port makes it possible to boot the standard Pi 5 model B directly off NVMe storageâ€”an option which is much faster and more reliable than standard microSD storage.

The Raspberry Pi 5's PCIe interface opens up new possibilities for high-performance storage in educational computing environments.

### Performance Benefits

**Dramatic Speed Improvements**: Its PCIe speeds are limited to the point where you'll get around 700-800 MB/s out of an NVME when reading data, and about half that when writing data.

**Real-World Performance**: A simple speed test showed the NVME HAT on my Pi5 is roughly 18x faster than a good uSD card on the old Pi4.

**Boot Time Improvements**: Similar to microSD, around 6-8 seconds with Pi OS. The boot time is highly optimized, and the NVMe's speed advantage isn't as great there as other storage-related tasks like file copies, installs, launching heavy apps.

### Enhanced Reliability

**Durability Advantages**: It's not just about speed, though. NVMe storage is also more durable than MicroSD cards. MicroSD cards can wear out quickly under heavy use, while NVMe drives are built to handle consistent data loads over time.

**Better Error Handling**: NVMe drives typically include more sophisticated wear leveling and error correction capabilities compared to MicroSD cards.

### Setup Requirements

**Hardware Prerequisites**: To use NVMe with Raspberry Pi 5, you'll need:
- A Raspberry Pi 5 (older models don't support PCIe)
- An M.2 HAT or adapter (various manufacturers available)
- A compatible NVMe SSD

**Software Configuration**: Enabling NVMe boot is pretty easy, you add a line to /boot/firmware/config.txt, modify the BOOT_ORDER in the bootloader configuration, and reboot!

**PCIe Speed Considerations**: You can double the speed of NVMe by adding "dtparam=pciex1_gen=3" to config.txt, with hdparm reporting 749.57 MB/sec, though the Pi is only officially rated for PCIe Gen 2 speeds.

### Cost Analysis

**Economic Considerations**: The difference in price per GB when comparing an A2 SD card with 512GB storage to an NVMe SSD of the same capacity isn't earth-shattering. For 256GB models, there is a $10 difference, but the benefits outweigh the cost.

**Long-term Value**: While the initial investment is higher, the improved reliability and performance can reduce maintenance overhead in classroom environments.
